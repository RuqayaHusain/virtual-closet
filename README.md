# üëó Virtual Closet App

The Virtual Closet app is a personal wardrobe manager where users can create a digital version of their closet.  
It allows adding clothing items, organizing them into outfits, and viewing all wardrobe items in one place.  

This app was built as part of a full-stack project using Node.js and MongoDB.  
It combines authentication, CRUD functionality, and relational data modeling to meet assignment requirements.

## ‚ú® Inspiration
The idea for this app was inspired by the movie *Clueless* (1995).  
In the film, the main character Cher uses a computer program to browse her wardrobe and put together outfits.  
This project reimagines that concept with modern web technologies, giving users their own digital closet to store clothing items and create outfits.
